# Bob The Butler
A general purpose / fun bot for Discord &amp; Telegram.

All features are kept the same between both the discord and the telegram version. The only big difference being telegram does not have a radio module.

# Discord

The discord version of Bob The Butler. Works in servers and dm's. 

## Install

Once cloned you will need to create a token file called `token.secret` inside the discord folder and place your bots token in that file.

### Requirements:
We are now using [PyCord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) instead of Discord.py for slash command support

    python3 -m pip install -U "py-cord[voice]"

Also requires `FFMPEG` for the radio module.

# Telegram

Telegram version will be uploaded later!

## Install
Install the python package

    pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade
